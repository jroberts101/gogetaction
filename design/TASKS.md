# Tasks required to implement, build, test and deploy the "GoGetAction" application
This “first‑day” checklist should be used to establish the project structure. It assumes a monorepo living at the root of the Git repository.

## 1. Project Initialization
- [x] Create this `TASKS.md` checklist file.
- [x] Write this checklist.
- [x] Set up version control repository (e.g., GitHub).
- [ ] Initialize project structure (folders for backend, frontend, docs, etc.).
- [ ] Set up code formatting and linting tools.
- [ ] Define and document coding standards.

## 2. Requirements & Planning
- [ ] Review and finalize functional requirements.
- [ ] Review and finalize non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability, etc.).
- [ ] Identify and document user roles and permissions.
- [ ] Define API contracts and data models.
- [ ] Create user stories and acceptance criteria.

## 3. Architecture & Design
- [ ] Review and understand the software architecture document.
- [ ] Design system components as per architecture (frontend, backend, database, integrations).
- [ ] Define interfaces between components.
- [ ] Create sequence and flow diagrams for key processes.
- [ ] Select technology stack (frameworks, libraries, databases, etc.).
- [ ] Plan for scalability, security, and maintainability.

## 4. Environment Setup
- [ ] Set up local development environments for all components.
- [ ] Configure development, staging, and production environments.
- [ ] Set up environment variables and secrets management.
- [ ] Provision and configure databases.
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated builds and tests.

## 5. Backend Implementation
- [ ] Scaffold backend project structure.
- [ ] Implement authentication and authorization.
- [ ] Implement core business logic modules.
- [ ] Develop RESTful APIs as per contracts.
- [ ] Integrate with external services/APIs as required.
- [ ] Implement data validation and error handling.
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests for backend logic.
- [ ] Document backend API endpoints.

## 6. Frontend Implementation
- [ ] Scaffold frontend project structure.
- [ ] Implement authentication flows.
- [ ] Develop UI components as per design.
- [ ] Integrate frontend with backend APIs.
- [ ] Implement state management.
- [ ] Ensure responsive and accessible design.
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests for frontend components.
- [ ] Document usage and setup instructions.

## 7. Database & Persistence
- [ ] Design and document database schema.
- [ ] Implement database migrations.
- [ ] Set up ORM/ODM or database access layer.
- [ ] Seed initial data if required.
- [ ] Write tests for data access logic.

## 8. Testing
- [ ] Write and maintain unit tests for all modules.
- [ ] Write integration tests for component interactions.
- [ ] Write end-to-end (E2E) tests for user flows.
- [ ] Set up automated test execution in CI/CD.
- [ ] Conduct manual exploratory testing.
- [ ] Perform security and performance testing.

## 9. Documentation
- [ ] Document system architecture and design decisions.
- [ ] Write API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger or similar).
- [ ] Document deployment and environment setup.
- [ ] Prepare user and admin guides.
- [ ] Maintain changelog and release notes.

## 10. Deployment & Release
- [ ] Prepare deployment scripts and configuration.
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging.
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment for UAT.
- [ ] Address feedback and fix issues from UAT.
- [ ] Deploy to production environment.
- [ ] Verify deployment and perform smoke tests.
- [ ] Set up backup and disaster recovery procedures.

## 11. Maintenance & Support
- [ ] Monitor application health and logs.
- [ ] Address bugs and incidents.
- [ ] Plan for feature updates and improvements.
- [ ] Regularly update dependencies and patch vulnerabilities.
